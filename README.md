# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The Work Day Schedule application is a simple calendar app for scheduling a work day. The current day is displayed at the top of the page. The schedule is displayed as lines with an hour, the area for text input, a save button for each hour. A work day starts at 9AM and finishes at 5PM. The current hour area is colored red. The hours before the current hour are colored grey. The hours after the current hour are colored green. A new task will be stored once a "Save" button is clicked in the same line where the task is typed. The tasks are persistent and will be loaded in case the page is refreshed or closed/opened again.
